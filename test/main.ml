(* Test Plan: We tested functions automatically by OUnit across our state 
and player modules. Test cases were developed using both glass box and 
black box testing. We started with black box testing functions to evaluate 
if our functions returned the appropriate result that we were looking for. 
We utilized black box testing throughout our Test Driven Development until 
we finished the game. We omitted testing printed prompts in turn.ml and 
functions that generated random civilizations. This is because the 
functions in turn.ml is dependent on the functionality of the rest of the 
modules in our project and generating randomness for different types in the 
game is for the opponent, which are both invisible and unimportant for our 
player in Civ4. Once we finished our game, we utilized glass box testing 
to evaluate branches in our functions that were not examined as our game 
progressed. This procedure for testing asserts that exceptions are raised 
when invalid prompts are given to functions. This test plan demonstrates 
the correctness of our system because it evaluates branches of functions 
essential to both the gameâ€™s functionality and the user.
